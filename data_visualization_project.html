                <p>This is an old group project from my time at 
                    the university. The course was called 
                    “Data Visualization”. We were a team of three people: 
                    two computer science students and one digital media 
                    student. While the digital media major was in charge of 
                    designing the website, we CS students had to implement 
                    the design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>The data we used in the application is from the Website of 
                    <a class="project-article-link" 
                        target="_blank"
                        href="https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/DE/Navigation/Statistiken/Interaktive-Statistiken/Pendler/Pendler-Nav.html;jsessionid=26C4EDA2980F3515E643D42B03B2680F?Thema%3DEinpendler%26DR_Land%3D12000000%26DR_Gebiete%3Dall%26toggleswitch%3D0">
                        Bundesagentur für Arbeit</a>, 
                    where we got ourselves a CSV file that had to be filtered to 
                    only give us the relevant statistics for the project. 
                    The interactive map used is created with a geojson-file 
                    that we got from a site called 
                    <a class="project-article-link"
                        target="_blank"
                        href="https://opendatalab.de/projects/geojson-utilities/">
                        OpenDataLab</a>. Originally, we had 
                    some consistency issues, where sometimes the site would 
                    not be working properly, and we needed to reload the 
                    page a few times until it functioned as intended. 
                    Other Groups encounter the same problem. Our professor explained 
                    that it was due to us loading multiple files and showed us how to 
                    fix it. However, by that time, our group had a different workaround. 
                    We put the filtered data from the CSV file into the geojson-file. 
                    It also made working the data a little easier, since everything was 
                    in one file. That little trick was certainly not a smart solution for 
                    big projects, but for our little application, it was enough.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Sadly, nobody kept the code for this project, 
                        so the only thing left of it is this one 
                        picture, and the only reason this image 
                        still exists is because my team partner 
                        planned to show this project on his own portfolio.</p>
